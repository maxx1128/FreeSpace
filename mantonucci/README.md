# One-Page Page

A nicely-styled, sleek, responsive page with animations, dark mode, and other nice touches.

Also all done _in a single file._ No tools, compilers, dependencies, partials, or directories. Just a single file.

Done to show how the tools aren't as strong as the code itself. Also because I thought it'd be fun and challenging.
